          I am a private tutor and I have been teaching for the last 4years. I
          expect and I give my 200% for student's bright future. My teaching
          method is flexible, changes depending on the student's interest.
          However, for a better understanding of the topic, I often use audio
          visual aids. I also take a weekly test to make sure the student is
          thorough with the topic that has been taught.
